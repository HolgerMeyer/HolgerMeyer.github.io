        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3><u>ITM - International Thai Massage School Chiang Mai</u></h3>
        <p>Holger had collected an unsually large fund during his time at the Frankfurt School of Finance. Some might say he conducted shady finance deals with the elderly, however this is untrue. Finally he was able to go after his mission to relax humanity and give back to the females. He still felt guilty for the Wener von Siemens incident. </p>
        <h3><u>Frankfurt School of Finance</u></h3>
        <p>Holger quickly realised that Thai massages were not cutting his needs. As he spent over 1000â‚¬ monthly on activist clubs supporting nude swimming, he needed additional funds. Due to his great effort in school he was able to join the Frankfurt School of Finance. Many of his friends did not share his passion for nude swimming.</p>
        <h3><u>Werner von Siemens Schule Frankfurt</u></h3>
        <p>While Holger seemed to be a lost soul in school, he managed to graduate with expectional results. His teachers often times applauded him for his effort. Holger was only detained once when he tried to peek in the girls bathroom. He quickly accepted his boundaries and changed for the better by pursuing a carreer in professional Thai massage. A profession well known for the needed respect of the females.</p>
